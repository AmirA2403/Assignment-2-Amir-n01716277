I chose this code layout and styling approach to create a visually appealing and user-friendly travel agency website. The CSS styles prioritize readability, with a clean, modern font and soft, neutral background colors. The navigation bar uses a sticky position for easy access while scrolling, enhancing the overall user experience. The video background on the homepage includes an overlay text with a semi-transparent background, designed to draw attention to the introductory message without distracting from the video. Rounded corners on buttons and cards create a cohesive look and feel, while hover effects add interactivity, making the design more engaging. Media queries are used to ensure the website is responsive, adjusting smoothly for mobile and desktop users. The layout is organized into containers, making it easy to adapt or add content, which is crucial for scalability.
